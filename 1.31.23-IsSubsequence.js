// Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

// A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

// Comments//
 //Is the s string a subsequence of t string or not?
 //True or False
 //We want to find characters that are in the same position
 //loop through to compare the index positions, create an array.
