// Write a function that takes in a list or an array of numbers. The function should return the sum of any numbers from the list that are either greater than 10 or less than 5

// create a variable called 'sum'.

const sumOfNumOverTenOrUnderFive = (nums) =>{
    let sum = 0;

// We will need to start the variable at zero and iterate through each # in the given array. We can use a for loop for this.
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++);
// With an if statement we will check whether each element is greater than 10 or less than 5.

// If the element meets the above criteria the function adds the element's value to the a 'sum' variable.

// If the function returns the value of 'sum'.  This will be the sum of all the elements in the array that are either > 10 or < 5.
